					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<div class="content">
						<p>You can't win big by playing it safe. The single trait shared by the most successful businesses we've worked with is hands down their willingness to step out of their comfort zone.</p>

						<p>The digital landscape changes constantly, and relying on common practices (or what you've always done) won't be enough for your clients' businesses to thrive, let alone get them ahead of the pack. So if you're looking for a partner to maintain the status quo for you, please look elsewhere.</p>

						<p>If you share our belief that forward thinkers win the day, then we are probably a good fit.</p>

						<p>We always go the extra mile to make you (or your clients) happy. And we found the only way to make sure you remain happy over time is to keep an open mind and to constantly evolve so we can keep that edge that allows us to put you on top. That's what we are all about.</p>

				<!-- our mission -->
				<div class="our-mission">
					<h1>Our mission</h1>

					<h4>Take you and your clients to the next level.</h4>

					<p>How? With thorough planning and seamless execution, with digital strategists and speciality experts. There is no one formula, just know-how and a lot of hard work.</p>

					<p>So you are allowed - encouraged even - to dream big. We can take it. <b>Our goal is to make you and/or your clients happy.</b> No kidding. Did you think we picked "happy web" as our brand just because? Think again.</p>
