					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<div class="content">
						<p>You can't win big by playing it safe. The single trait shared by the most successful businesses we've worked with is hands down their willingness to step out of their comfort zone.</p>

						<p>The digital landscape changes constantly, and relying on common practices (or what you've always done) won't be enough for your clients' businesses to thrive, let alone get them ahead of the pack. So if you're looking for a partner to maintain the status quo for you, please look elsewhere.</p>

						<p>If you share our belief that forward thinkers win the day, then we are probably a good fit.</p>

						<p>We always go the extra mile to make you (or your clients) happy. And we found the only way to make sure you remain happy over time is to keep an open mind and to constantly evolve so we can keep that edge that allows us to put you on top. That's what we are all about.</p>

				<!-- our mission -->
				<div class="our-mission">
					<h1>Our mission</h1>

					<h4>Take you and your clients to the next level.</h4>

					<p>How? With thorough planning and seamless execution, with digital strategists and speciality experts. There is no one formula, just know-how and a lot of hard work.</p>

					<p>So you are allowed - encouraged even - to dream big. We can take it. <b>Our goal is to make you and/or your clients happy.</b> No kidding. Did you think we picked "happy web" as our brand just because? Think again.</p>

				who we are
			</h1>

			<div class="right">
				<p>Happyweb was founded in 2015 in Montpellier, France. We started out as conversion optimization specialists, helping clients and agencies alike increase their bottom line. Since then we've invested a lot of time and resources to be able to execute proficiently on complementary spheres of expertise.</p>

				<p>Acquisition strategy services (strategy only, we don't execute) so we can help your clients find the right path to sustainable traffic generation. It is absolutely critical in today's digital economy where brands live and die by the content they publish (what content, where, for whom, to what end?). It is more and more difficult to deliver results without a global strategical approach to acquisition.</p>

				<p>And data implementation services, because more than ever before clients need actionable data to drive their businesses and keep growing. Your clients have many questions; we help them collect the answers they need so they can make informed decisions and thrive.</p>

				<p>Last year we also added design and web development (Shopify) as well; web design because this was a recurring need in our daily CRO activity and for the site redesigns we were managing; web development because it allowed us to get faster from strategy and testing to execution and implementation.</p>

				<p>We have fully embraced the remote culture and our team works from 8 countries. Everybody on our team has a strong digital background and is an expert in their field; by choosing happyWeb, you ensure you and/or your clients get the valuable know-how they need to grow.</p>
